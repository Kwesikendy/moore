3. ✅ Created `.env` file with backend API URL
4. ✅ Updated `index.html` to reference correct entry point

## � If You Still See the Vite Template

The IDE may be showing cached TypeScript errors, but the app should work. Try:

1. **Hard Refresh Browser:**
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

2. **If that doesn't work, restart the dev server:**
   - Press `Ctrl + C` in the admin terminal
   - Run: `npm run dev`
   - Then refresh browser

3. **Clear IDE errors:**
   - The TypeScript errors in the IDE are cached
   - Close and reopen VS Code if needed
